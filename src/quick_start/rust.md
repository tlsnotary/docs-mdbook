# Rust Quick Start

This Quick Start demonstrates the simplest possible use case for TLSNotary. A Prover notarizes data from a local test server with a local Notary.

## Requirements

Before we start, make sure you have cloned the `tlsn` repository and have a recent version of Rust installed.

1. Clone the `tlsn` repository (defaults to the `main` branch, which points to the latest release):
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn.git
    ```
2. If you don't have Rust installed yet, you can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). If your Rust version is outdated, update it with `rustup update stable`.
