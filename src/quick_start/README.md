# Quick Start

This quick start will help you get started with TLSNotary, both in native [Rust](rust.md) and in the [browser](browser_extension.md).

1. [Most Basic Example: Proving and Verifying Public Data (Rust)](rust.md#rust-simple)
2. [Proving and Verifying a Private Discord DM (Rust)](rust.md#rust-discord)
3. [Proving and Verifying ownership of a Twitter account (Browser)](browser_extension.md#browser)

Objectives of this quick start:
* Gain a better understanding of what you can do with TLSNotary
* Learn the basics of how to prove and verify data using TLSNotary

Let's [start](rust.md)!
