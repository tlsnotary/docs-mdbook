# Commitment scheme

<!-- TODO will polish -->

BEFORE the `Notary` "opens his gabled circuit" in Step 17 of [DEAP](deap.md), the `User` commits (e.g. computes a blake3 hash) to the encodings of the plaintext generated by the `Notary` (i.e. the encoded output [v]_B from Step 8 in DEAP).

"Opening the garbled circuit" simply means that the `Notary` reveals and signs the seed of randomness which (among other things) was used to generate the [encoding](encodings.md) of the plaintext. 

Having both the signed seed from the `Notary` and also the commitment to the plaintext encoding, the `User` can prove to any third-party Verifier the authenticity of the plaintext.
