# Introduction

## Data Provenance without Compromising Privacy, That is Why!

The Internet currently lacks effective, privacy-preserving **Data Provenance**. [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), also known as the "s" in "https" üîê to the general public, ensures that data can be securely communicated between a server and a user. But how can this user credibly share this data with another user or server without compromising security, privacy, and control?

Enter TLSNotary: a protocol enabling users to export data securely from any website. Using Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, this data can be selectively shared with others in a cryptographically verifiable manner.

TLSNotary makes data truly portable and allows users to share it with others as they see fit.

## How Does the TLSNotary Protocol Work?

The TLSNotary protocol consists of 4 steps:
1. The `User` **requests** the data from the `Server` privately and securely.
2. The `Notary` **checks** for data tampering and **signs** the data.
3. The `User` **selectively discloses** the data to the `Verifier`.
4. The `Verifier` **verifies** the data.

### ‚ë† Multi-party TLS Request

TLSNotary works by adding a third party, the `Notary`, to the usual TLS connection between the `User` and a `Server`. This `Notary` is **not "[a man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)"**. Instead, the `Notary` participates in a **secure multi-party computation** (MPC) to jointly operate the TLS connection without ever seeing the data in plain text; the `Notary` only sees encrypted data. Given that the `Notary` only sees the temporary key of the `Server`, the `Notary` does not know which `Server` the `User` is communicating with. The TLSNotary protocol is transparent to the `Server`. From the `Server`'s perspective, the `User`'s connection is a standard TLS connection.

<!-- - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - Encryption: hides data from third parties
    - Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be
    - Integrity: verifies that data has not been forged or tampered with -->
### ‚ë° Notarization

By participating in the **secure multi-party computation** (MPC) for TLS communication, the `Notary` can validate the authenticity and integrity of the `User`'s communication with the `Server`. If the `User` was honest, the `Notary` **signs** the transcript of the entire TLS session. Since the `Notary` only validates encrypted data, this process is referred to as "blind signing".

### ‚ë¢ Selective Disclosure

The TLSNotary protocol provides a means for the `User` to selectively prove the authenticity of arbitrary sections of the transcript to a `Verifier`. In this context, the `User` is often referred to as the `Prover`.

The `User` can **redact sections** of the transcript, thereby not disclosing sensitive data to the `Verifier`. This capability can be paired with Zero-Knowledge Proofs to prove properties of the redacted data without revealing the data itself.

### ‚ë£ Verification

A `Verifier` validates the proof received from the `User`. By comparing the signature against the `Notary`'s public key, the `Verifier` ensures that the `User` did not tamper with the data.  
The data origin can be verified by inspecting the `Server` certificate through trusted certificate authorities (CAs).

### Trust Assumptions

TLSNotary requires a trust assumption. A `Verifier` of a proof must trust that the `Notary` did not collude with the `User` to forge it. This trust can be minimized by requiring multiple proofs, each signed by a different notary.

In certain applications, the `Verifier` might also function as the `Notary`, leading to **fully trustless proofs**.

## What Can TLSNotary Do?

TLSNotary can be used for various purposes. For example, you can use TLSNotary to prove that:
- you have access to an account on a web platform
- a website showed specific content on a certain date
- you have private information about yourself (address, birth date, health, etc.)
- you have received a money transfer using your online banking account without revealing your login credentials or sensitive financial information
- you received a private message from someone
- you were blocked from using an app
- you earned professional certificates

While TLSNotary can notarize publicly available data, it does not solve the "[oracle problem](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/)". For this use case, existing oracle solutions are more suitable.

## Who is behind TLSNotary?

TLSNotary is developed by the [Privacy and Scaling Exploration (PSE)](https://pse.dev) research lab of the Ethereum Foundation. The PSE team is committed to conceptualizing and testing use cases for cryptographic primitives.

TLSNotary is not a new project; in fact, it has been around for [more than a decade](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=173220.0).

In 2022, TLSNotary was rebuilt from the ground up in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) incorporating state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols. This renewed version of the TLSNotary protocol offers enhanced security, privacy, and performance.

Older versions of TLSNotary, including PageSigner, have been archived due to a security vulnerability.
