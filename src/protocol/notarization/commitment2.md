# Commitment

The TLSNotary protocol entirely conceals the plaintext transcript from the `Notary`. Simultaneously, the TLSNotary protocol offers a way to the `User` to selectively prove the authenticity of arbitrary portions of the plaintext to the `Verifier`.

A naive approach could extend the `Encryption and Decryption` steps to also compute a commitment (e.g. a blake3 hash) to the plaintext in MPC, with the `Notary` signing that commitment. The `User` could then open the commitment to the `Verifier`. Unfortunately, this approach would be resource-intensive, prompting us to describe a more lightweight way of producing commitments.

The high-level concept is that the `User` will commit to the [encodings](/building_blocks/encodings.md) of the plaintext during the execution of the [DEAP](/building_blocks/deap_deferred.md) protocol. As these encodings are chosen by the `Notary` and unknown to the `User` at the time of commitment, they can be regarded as "authenticated plaintext".

More low-level details for creating such a commitment include:

Before the `Notary` "opens his garbled circuit" in Step 17 of [DEAP](/building_blocks/deap_deferred.md), the `User` commits (e.g., computes a blake3 hash) to the encodings of the plaintext generated by the `Notary` (i.e., the encoded output [v]_B from Step 8 in DEAP).

"Opening the garbled circuit" simply means that the `Notary` reveals and signs the seed of randomness, which, among other things, was used to generate the [encoding](/building_blocks/encodings.md) of the plaintext.

With both the signed seed from the `Notary` and the commitment to the plaintext encoding, the `User` can prove the authenticity of the plaintext to any third-party `Verifier`.
