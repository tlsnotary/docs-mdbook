# Quick Start

In this guide we will set up a general-purpose TLS verifier ( a.k.a. the `Notary`), so that a `Prover` can notarize some TLS data and generate a proof which he then shows to a `Verifier` for selective disclosure.

So this guide will take you through the steps of:
- starting a `Notary` server
- running a `Prover` to notarize some web data
- running a `Verifier` to verify the notarized data

## Preliminaries

### Install rust

If you don't have `rust` installed yet, install it with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Guide
Clone this repository first

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn
```

### Start a simple Notary server:

```shell
cd tlsn/tlsn/examples/simple
cargo run --release --example simple_notary
```

The `Notary` server will now be running in the background waiting for connections from a `Prover`. You can switch to another console to run the `Prover`.

P/S: The notary server used in this example is less functional compared to its [advanced version](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn/tree/dev/notary-server). This simple version is easier to integrate with from prover perspective, whereas the advanced version provides additional features like TLS connection with prover, WebSocket endpoint, API endpoints for further customisation etc.

### Run a simple Prover:

```shell
RUST_LOG=DEBUG,yamux=INFO cargo run --release --example simple_prover
```

The notarization session usually takes a few moments and the resulting proof will be written to the "proof.json" file. The proof can then be passed on to the `Verifier` for verification.

The `simple_prover` notarizes <https://example.com> and redacts the `USER_AGENT` HTTP header from the proof for the `Verifier`. You can change the code in `tlsn/tlsn/examples/simple/simple_prover.rs` to meet your needs:

- change which server the `Prover` connects to
- add or remove HTTP request headers
- redact other strings in the request or the response

⚠️ Please note that by default the `Notary` server expects that the cumulative size of the request and the server response is not more than 16KB.


### Run a simple Verifier:

```shell
cargo run --release --example simple_verifier
```

This will verify the proof from the `simple_prover` (`proof.json`) and output the result to the console.

Note how the parts which the prover chose not to disclose will be shown as "X":
```plaintext
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: example.com
accept: */*
accept-encoding: identity
connection: close
user-agent: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
